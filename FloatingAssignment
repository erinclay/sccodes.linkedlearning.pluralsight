// These are a few simple tests we'll run against your code.
// They're written in JavaScript, so feel free to read these.
// Don't worry. It's ok if you can't understand this code yet.
// You can also ignore this file for now :)
// I can edit this and the script tags in the html file later to add my own ish...
